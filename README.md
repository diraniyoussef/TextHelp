# TextHelp
The teacher loads a text (usually from the lesson) to the activity. 
She will be able to select, the way she wants, from the text, and record her voice. 
The student, when he selects any word, will be able to see the text (that the teacher had assigned) highlighted and 
will hear the teacher's recorded comment.
